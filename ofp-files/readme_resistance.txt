***** OPERATION FLASHPOINT: RESISTANCE README *****

This package will install Flashpoint: Resistance to your Operation Flashpoint directory.



REQUIRED:
=========
ORIGINAL VERSION OF OPERATION FLASHPOINT.



HOW TO INSTALL:
===============
When you insert the Resistance disc you should be presented with the option to install.  
If Resistance does not start automatically when you insert the disc, browse to the CD and double-click on "Setup.exe".  
You will then be prompted to enter the Installation Access Code found on the inside back cover of the Resistance manual. Alternatively, go to the start menu and select RUN. Type D:\setup (replace 'D' with the drive letter of your CD or DVD drive) and hit [ENTER].



HOW TO RUN:
===========

>From the Start menu Click Start -> Programs -> Codemasters -> Flashpoint Resistance, making sure your Resistance CD is in the CD-ROM drive.

You can select which application you want to run from the Flashpoint Preferences program or you can click directly to the program shortcut in the Start menu.

To successfully run a Dedicated Server you need to find the file Flashpoint.cfg in your OperationFlashpoint directory, right-click on it, select Properties, uncheck the 'Read-only' box at the bottom of the dialog and click on Apply. This only needs to be done once. Then run the dedicated server executable as normal.

NB: Your original Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis shortcut(s) and .exe(s) will no longer function, though the original campaign will still be available through Operation Flashpoint: Resistance.


WHAT'S NEW
==========

New Resistance campaign
-----------------------

Open the 'Campaign Game' book and click on the black arrow at the top right of the page until 'Flashpoint: Resistance' 
is at the top. Click 'Start' to play the new campaign.

The new campaign included in Operation Flashpoint: Resistance forms a prequel to the original game's plot and is set several years before Operation Flashpoint's Cold War hit crisis point. 
Operation Flashpoint: Resistance casts the player as Victor Troska, ex-Special Forces soldier, living a peaceful civilian life on the island of Nogova, a short distance from the original game's three islands. 
However, his situation changes when a Soviet force invades the island group and destroys Troska's idyllic dreams.

Teammates: As you go through the campaign, you will quickly become the leader of your group. As your teammates survive battles, they will become more experienced. Try to keep them alive and you will be rewarded with a more highly skilled and experienced team. 

Weapons: You are very short of specialist weapons in OFP: Resistance. Collect as many varied weapons as possible (you can now put weapons in your vehicles and ammo crates) and try not to lose them. 
If your sniper dies, you can send someone for his rifle - you will need it. Any weapon you take in one mission will be available later.

Vehicles: The same for your vehicles, if you are not able to steal enemy tanks in a mission where that is the goal, your attack on a heavily guarded enemy position will be much more difficult later.

It's important to use Group and Gear sections in the Briefing before every mission.


New single player missions
---------------------------

There are 5 new single player missions included. Select Single Missions and double-click 'Resistance...' to access new single player missions

New multiplayer missions

New graphics

Please note that by setting the values beyond the performance range of your PC you may get very low performance and frame-rates in the game.

CHANGES TO MANUAL
=================

The Multiplayer Setup screen has been improved with added functionality since the manual was printed.

You can now add filters to the list of Internet games displayed and arrange the server list by Server name, Mission name, Server status, Number of players and Ping by clicking on the column titles.

The Internet server list only displays servers that are compatible with your current version of the game.
Also, a server will only be displayed if it is a Dedicated Server which has been created using GameSpy Arcade(TM).
To join a game which has not been created as above, you must enter the server IP address manually as described in the manual.

Finally, the island is called Nogova and not Nogovo as mentioned in the Manual.



TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you encounter any problems during installation of the game:
  - Make sure you have your original Operation Flashpoint CD and manual to hand.
  - Uninstall Flashpoint completely by going to the Start menu and selecting 'UnInstall Operation Flashpoint'
  - Make sure to delete any left-over files in your 'Operation Flashpoint' directory
  - Now reinstall Operation Flashpoint.
  - Once it has installed, reinstall Resistance.

If at any point during the Campaign you find the game is becoming too difficult, it is recommended that you REVERT to an earlier point in the Campaign and concentrate on both collecting more weapons and ammunition and keeping more of your troops alive.

If at any point during a mission you become stuck, or the mission does not progress it is recommended that you restart the mission from the beginning.

If you encounter any sound or graphical issues while running the game, please make sure you have installed the latest versions of your hardware drivers before contacting customer support.
